# Hi, I'm Parthiban Rajasekaran 👋

I am a seasoned Quality Assurance Advocate leading the way in Quality Engineering and Test Automation. I have a rich history of working with renowned organizations, driving innovation, efficiency, and accuracy in the QA domain. I'm also an ISTQB-certified expert in Scrum and Agile methodologies. 

As a global ambassador for Cypress and Pynt, I am committed to empowering the QA community by sharing my knowledge and advocating for industry-leading best practices. With a focus on test management, automation, strategy, and execution, I aim to create an environment that prioritizes collaboration and stakeholder engagement.

🔭 Currently working as a freelance Test Automation Consultant, I am focused on designing and implementing custom test automation frameworks, integrating API testing with UI automation, and mentoring client teams on agile methodologies.

🌱 I am proficient in programming/scripting languages such as Java, Groovy, JavaScript, C#, VBScript, SQL, TypeScript, and Scala. I have hands-on experience with Infrastructure tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Rancher, and CI/CD platforms such as GitLab-CI, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and Nexus.

💬 Ask me about Selenium, Cypress, Playwright, Postman/Newman, REST Assured, Insomnia, and anything QA!
